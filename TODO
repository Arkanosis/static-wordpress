* Critical
 - Security: prevent the script from writing outside of the working directory
* Major
 - Command line options (base url, download images, scripts…)
* Normal
 - Also download js / css / images from other domains and fix the relevant hrefs in the html / js / css
* Minor
 - Blacklist ads js / css / images (don't download them, and remove the relevant hrefs in the html)
 - Remove useless stuff (comments, login, search…)
